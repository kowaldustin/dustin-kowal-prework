                        I am Dustin Kowal and I just completed my B.S. in Computer Information Systems. 
                        I enjoy programming because it allows me to tap into my creative side and design 
                        whatever I want from scratch. One of my earliest desires was to become an artist 
                        but I soon realized that my artistic skills are not aligned with that dream. 
                        However through software engineering and design I am still able to achieve that original desire.

            <div class="row p-2">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>
                        Now that my time is no longer filled with homework and school studies I rely on my 
                        two main hobbies to survive the quarantine situation. These are music and appreciation 
                        of nature. One of my favorite pass times, especially in Duluth, is finding a new hiking 
                        trail or interesting spot whether it's a waterfall, old foundations, or some other pituresque spot.

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>
                        When the weather is not cooperative I turn to my other hobby, playing piano or guitar. 
                        Recently I've had a lot of fun attempting to recreate classic rock songs like Hold Me Now 
                        without referencing any other music, essentially seeing how close I can get to the original 
                        sound and feel of the song.
